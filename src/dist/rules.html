        <strong>â‚¬5000</strong> Sports Bonus is awarded the last man standing. It means that the participant
        who gets the furthest whilst others have dropped out is the winner. In case several
        competitors drop out at the same time and nobody else is left in the competition,
        the prize shall be shared between those participants. In case several participants
        win their bets on the last day of the competition (25th February), the prize pool shall
        be shared between them as well.
